# StaticGates

A [StaticGate](StaticGate.cs) is a simple object that encapsulates a boolean: it can be opened or closed.

This is, we think, the most possible efficient implementation to enable/disable logging since it relies on the
[null-conditional operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operators#null-conditional-operators--and-)
to return a `IActivityMonitor` or null (actually any type of object can be used through a gate).

> This is a trick... But optimal because every log creation code is skipped (there is absolutely no method calls when a 
> gate is closed) and thanks to the Nullable Reference warnings mostly safe to use.

## A StaticGate lives forever, it should be a static object

To create a gate, simply instantiate it and stores the reference in a static readonly field.
This field can be safely exposed publicly, here is the gate definition of the [AsyncLock](../AsyncLock.md):

```csharp
public sealed class AsyncLock
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The gate that controls logging for AsyncLock. Can be reused by other async related
    /// features. It is closed by default.
    /// </summary>
    public static readonly StaticGate Gate = new StaticGate( nameof(AsyncLock), false );

    ...
}
```

The name (here "AsyncLock") is a DisplayName, it doesn't have to be unique. The constructor captures the file name and line number
of the instantiation however even this is not used as an identity. The true identity of a StaticGate is provided
by the [CoreApplicationIdentity.InstanceId](https://github.com/Invenietis/CK-Core/blob/master/CK.Core/CoreApplicationIdentity/README.md)
of the running application and the `int Key { get; }` (an incremented index for each gate created).

Gates that have DisplayName can be configured by the [StaticGatesConfigurator](StaticGatesConfigurator.cs) (see below).

**Important:** As an optimization, the .Net runtime defers the initialization of the static fields of a Type until
 one of them is accessed: a StaticGate will only appear if it's used or if another static field of the Type is accessed.

To ensure that the static fields of a Type are initialized at the first `new MyType()` instance, one can
define an empty static constructor (called a Type Initializer). (The other trick that is to "touch" a static
field in the constructor works but is, by far, less elegant). 
See the tests [here](../../Tests/CK.ActivityMonitor.Tests//StaticGateTests.StaticGateHolder.cs).

## StaticGate opening and closing

Open/Close status is exposed by a simple writable property `bool IsOpen {get; set;}`.
For remote control of gates, the static `Open` method should be used:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Sets the <see cref="IsOpen"/> property of a gate by its key, ensuring that
/// <see cref="CoreApplicationIdentity.InstanceId"/> is known by the caller.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="key"></param>
/// <param name="instanceId">Must be <see cref="CoreApplicationIdentity.InstanceId"/>, otherwise nothing is done.</param>
/// <param name="open">True to open, false to close.</param>
/// <returns>True if the operation has been applied, false otherwise.</returns>
public static bool Open( int key, string instanceId, bool open )
```
This guaranties that the caller knows what he's doing: he must have obtained the instance identifier of the application and
have called `static IEnumerable<StaticGate> GetStaticGates()` to choose the relevant gate thanks to its properties
(`DisplayName`, `FilePath` and `LineNumber`).

## Usage: the `O` method and StaticLogger property

Using a gate is rather easy:
```csharp
Gate.O(monitor)?.Info( "I'll be emitted only if the Gate is opened." );
```

> This `T? O<T>( T instance )` method can be called **with any reference type**, not necessarily
a `IActivityMonitor`.

Another capability of a gate is to handle access to the [StaticLogger](../../README.md#emitting-logs-the-ilogger-static-contextless-way):
```csharp
Gate.StaticLogger?.Error( $"I'll be emitted only if the Gate is opened." );
```

## Where should StaticGate be used?
StaticGate should be used in low level code, in hot paths and when the feature is tied to
a well identified object or part of code (the AsyncLock is good example).

StaticGate should not be used in applicative layer, where activities flow across multiple
layers of code and the context of the callee is highly relevant: [Tags](../Impl/TagFiltering.md) are much more powerful.

## StaticGateConfigurator

This is a simple static helper that expose 2 methods:

```csharp
public static void ApplyConfiguration( IActivityMonitor? monitor, string configuration );
```
Applies a new configuration to gates that must have a real display name: gates without real display name are ignored.
The configuration string is simple: `"AsyncLock;LowLevelStuff;VeryLowLevelStuff:!"` will
open the first two and close the "VeryLowLevelStuff" gate.

The configuration applies until a new one is applied (the creation of new gates is tracked thanks to `StaticGate.OnNewStaticGate`.

```csharp
public static string GetConfiguration( bool? openedGates = null );
```
Gets a configuration string that can be applied later by calling `ApplyConfiguration`.
By default both opened and closed gates are returned. The `openedGates` can be set to true to only consider
the opened gates and false to only return the closed ones (suffixed by ":!").

The package [CK.Monitoring](https://github.com/Invenietis/CK-Monitoring) uses this to enable its
GrandOutput configuration to configure the StaticGates.
